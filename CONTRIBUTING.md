# Contribution Guideline

First and foremost, we welcome and appreciate your contribution to the **AWS Testing Guide**. Your insights and expertise will help enrich the documentation and benefit the entire community of AWS users. Here's a guide on how you can contribute:

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the AWS Testing Guide:

1. **Extend the Documentation**: If you have information or insights about additional AWS services, testing strategies, best practices, or any other relevant topics that are not currently covered in the guide, you can extend the documentation by adding new sections or expanding existing ones.
1. **Update the Documentation**: AWS services and features continually evolve. If you come across outdated information or changes in best practices, you can help by updating the documentation to reflect the latest information and ensure its accuracy.
1. **Fix Issues**: If you encounter any errors, typos, or formatting issues in the existing documentation, please feel free to fix them. Your attention to detail will help maintain the quality of the guide.

## Best Practices

When contributing to the AWS Testing Guide, it's important to follow certain best practices to ensure the documentation is clear, helpful, and user-friendly. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

1. **Be Polite and Professional**: Maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout the documentation. Use clear and concise language, and avoid jargon or overly technical terms when possible. Be mindful of your audience and strive to make the content accessible to users with varying levels of expertise.
1. **Be Practical and Actionable**: Focus on providing practical guidance and actionable steps that users can follow. Rather than focusing solely on high-level concepts, provide concrete examples, code snippets, and real-world scenarios to help users understand how to apply the information in practice.
1. **Give More Examples**: Examples play a crucial role in conveying concepts and illustrating best practices. Whenever possible, provide multiple examples that demonstrate different aspects of the topic at hand. These examples should be relevant, well-documented, and address common use cases or challenges.
1. **Less High-Level, More Hands-O**n: While high-level explanations can be helpful, prioritize hands-on guidance that users can directly implement. Encourage users to experiment, test, and explore AWS services by providing clear instructions, step-by-step processes, and tips for effective testing.

## Used Tools

The AWS Testing Guide is built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and Markdown, a lightweight markup language for formatting text. Familiarity with these tools is beneficial but not required. The documentation follows a simple and readable structure in Markdown format, making it easy to contribute without extensive technical knowledge.

## Development Process

To contribute to the AWS Testing Guide, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before making any changes, create an issue in the repository to discuss your proposed contribution. This allows for collaboration and ensures that your contribution aligns with the goals and guidelines of the guide. The maintainers will review the issue and provide feedback or suggestions.
1. **Create a Branch**: Once your planned contribution is reviewed, create a new branch in the repository to work on your changes. This ensures that your changes are isolated and can be reviewed independently.
1. **Checkout Repository**: Clone the repository to your local development environment and switch to the branch you created.
1. **Write Documentation**: Based on the existing documentation and the guidelines provided, write or update the documentation in Markdown format. Maintain a professional tone and follow the established style and structure.
1. **Create Sample Stack** (if necessary): If your contribution includes new examples or sample code, create a sample stack that utilizes AWS services relevant to the topic. Ensure that the stack adheres to best practices and highlights the testing aspects of the services.
1. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) in the repository. Provide a clear description of your contribution, including the purpose and impact of the changes. The maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback, and work with you to refine the contribution if needed.
1. **Merge the Pull Request**: After you have addressed the comments and suggestions provided during the pull request (PR) review process, and the necessary approvals have been received from the maintainers, the final step is to merge the PR. Once the PR is ready to be merged, the maintainers will review the changes one final time to ensure everything is in order. If there are no further concerns or outstanding issues, the maintainers will proceed to merge the PR into the main branch of the repository.

Upon successful merging of the PR, **congratulations**! Your contribution is now officially a part of the AWS Testing Guide.
